In each case, it took MINUTES before anything showed up, and then half the time whatever showed up didn't work. I tried restarting the puzzles and then, when that didn't work, I tried surrendering them, thinking those particular ones were just broken.  Still had to wait MINUTES for the next puzzles to appear and then those usually didn't work either, which is a shame, because this was really fun, but I couldn't really do the task because the game doesn't work correctly.  My strategy was just to try to get a working puzzle on screen.	"

Unfortunately, I encountered a few technical problems here where the game ""glitched"" and sometimes even refused to load the next level, which made me unable to complete everything.		"

ALH1K6ZAQQMN7:3IXEICO793RY7TM78ZBKJDOA7ADT6Q,strategy,"I call the blue 2-spaced objects ""cars"" and the blue 3-spaced objects ""trucks"". My strategy is always to look for the trucks that might get in each others way. They are usually the most obnoxious parts of the puzzle. As for the cars, I was look for little holes that aren't being used by anything else which usually an obstacle. That makes it much easier to move the other pieces around. The red car I usually only move when I know I won't have to move it back except in specific cases. I try to do as little backtracking as possible because that's an easy way to confuse oneself. All in all, I just try to make a goal and stick to it. If it doesn't work, I will understand the range of options I have at that point."
