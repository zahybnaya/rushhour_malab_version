I started getting stuck so I had to think about it a little bit, I found that the longest vertical pieces had to end up on the bottom for the piece to pass. In most cases getting all of the horizontal pieces to the left as a general strategy allowed me to figure out what pieces also had to be moved to get the long vertical pieces to the bottom. Those two goals pretty much also accomplished the REAL main goal of getting the red block out. "
