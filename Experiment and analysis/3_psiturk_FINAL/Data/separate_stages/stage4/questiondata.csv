I caught myself doing more than required a few times eating up a few extra seconds this way. thinking ahead a few moves saves time as well.

			also in case I don't get another chance to mention how long the game took to redraw between solution. started off 40 seconds then well over 4 minutes as the timer counted down this only allowed me to solve 20 something puzzles when in reality it was taking me 5 or 10 seconds to solve them. very unfair. though I imagine it's not something the researcher could have known and might be something pathological with my browser or OS. either way the time to redraw the board should not have subtracted from my time however long or short amount it took"
